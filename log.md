### Group 1 Seeds

| Date | |
|-|-|
|2019-02-02| Started a bunch of seeds (around 10+ in each of these):<ul><li>Paper towel method</li><li>Soil plate</li><li>Solo cups</li></ul>|
|2019-02-12| Noticed 3 seedling sprouts: 2 in the cups, 1 on the plate|
|2019-02-13| Plan now is to transfer all seedlings to hydro as there were aphids around the plate previously and the purchased seedlings seem to have proliferated them. <ul><li>Tossed the plate. 2 additional seedlings sprouted. Total: 4</li><li>Planted 1 of 4 seedlings in Aerogarden. Left the rest in solo cups.</li></ul> |
|2019-02-20| Seedlings still look good. The ones in the Aerogarden look the healthiest/biggest |


### Group 2 Seeds

| Date | |
|-|-|
|2019-02-12| Started 2 Aerogarden pods (2 seeds each) - 1 in Aerogarden and another on heating pad|
|2019-02-16| The Aerogarden pod was put in too much water and actually got moldy. This was tossed :( Transplanted the seeds over to rockwool cube|

### Purchased Seedlings
Purchased 3 seedlings that are about 45-60 days old: apocalypse chocolate, peach chost, 7 pot lava yellow

| Date | |
|-|-|
| 2019-02-12 | Purchased 3 seedlings|
| 2019-02-12 | Transplanted chocolypse into the Aerogarden Sprout|
| 2019-02-13 | Transplanted peach ghost, 7 pot lava yellow into Kratky |
| 2019-02-16 | Kratky ones look dubious as does the chocolypse. Thinking pH is off. It doesn't appear to be root rot though there is reddish/brown speckling the roots of the plants. The color is off on the plant - there seem to be burn mark like things all around it. One of the Kratky seedlings is seriously wilting |
| 2019-02-19 | Got pH kit towards the evening and put things into more pH balanced solutions. Discovered after googling that temperature affects pH so we after I put the nutes in the cups (which is heated at 67 degrees), the pH might change|

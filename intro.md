## How it all started
I jumped in the car as my husband pulled up to my building - he was picking me up from work as usual. He said he had just ran to Uwajimaya, a Japanese grocery store, and I was curious what dinner would be.

"What did you get"? <br/>
"A surprise" <br/>
"What's for dinner?" <br/>
"Oh, I didn't get anything for dinner" <br/>
????<br/>
"I'll show you at home"

At home, Spot pulled out a small carton. I noticed there were red fruits of some sort but the package was half empty. I picked it up and looked at it.

It said:
> Carolina Reapers
>
> Product of Holland

And so my hot pepper adventure begins...
